    #Data set that I found interest in: https://github.com/datasets/covid-19 <br> <br>
    This data set focuses on COVID-19. It includes the confirmed cases, recorded deaths, and recoveries. It was created 4 years ago and continues to be updated daily to be able to track any current or potential spikes. The source comes from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. They take information both nationally and worldwide to create patterns about the data that comes about from these sources. <br> <br>  

   #Book that interested me: A Course in Machine Learning by Hal Daume http://ciml.info/ <br><br>
	This text is about the basics of machine learning. It defines what machine learning is, its applications, and how it is integrated in subjects like artificial intelligence. I am currently taking the Machine learning class and would like to be able to use these texts as extra resources. It is a pretty complex subject, I would like to know as much of its background as possible.
